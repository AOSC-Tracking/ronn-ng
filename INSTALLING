Ronn-NG Installation
====================

## Installation Process

Ronn-NG is currently distributed mainly as a gem package. Install with rubygems:

    $ gem install ronn-ng
    $ ronn --help

### Installing Shell Tab Completion

Ronn-NG includes completion definitions for bash and zsh, but these are not
installed into the system locations as part of the gem. You will need to figure 
out how to install those into your system to make them available in your shell.

A decent way to do this is probably to add symlinks to your system shell
completion directories pointing at the files in the installed gem.

In Zsh, you can do something like this:

```
ronn_dist_dir=$(dirname $(dirname $(gem which ronn-ng)))
ronn_zsh_dir="$ronn_dist_dir/completion/zsh"
ln -s "$ronn_zsh_dir/_ronn" /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
```


## Building from Source

Hacking? Install Ronn-NG from source.

The nokogiri, mustache, and rdiscount packages are required:

    $ gem install nokogiri mustache rdiscount

Clone the git repository and put ronn/bin on your PATH:

    $ git clone git://github.com/apjanke/ronn-ng
    $ PATH=$(pwd)/ronn-ng/bin:$PATH
    $ ronn --help

Then you should be able to make changes directly to your cloned repo and have
them be reflected in your active `ronn` command.
