Ronn Changes and Release Notes
==============================

Version 0.6 (not yet released)
------------------------------

* The ronn(1) command line interface has changed in ways that are not
  backward-compatible with previous versions of ronn. The default behavior
  when one or more files are given is to build roff and HTML output files based
  on the input file names. Previous versions of ronn wrote to standard output
  unless the --build option was given. The new behavior is thought to be
  more sensible for people experimenting with the command for the first time and
  does not prevent any previously supported behavior.

  The default behavior when no files are given remains the same as previous
  versions: ronn source text is read from stdin and roff is written to stdout.

  See the `ronn --help' or the ronn(1) manpage for more on command line
  interface changes.

  (Ryan Tomayko, Chris Wanstrath)

* The markdown(5) manpage is no longer shipped with the ronn package. It is
  shipped with the latest version of rdiscount, however.
  (Ryan Tomayko, Suraj N. Kurapati)

* Added support for numbered lists in roff output. (Suraj N. Kurapati)

* Section headings in HTML output now include anchor / id attributes to make it
  possible to link to specific manual sections. (Suraj N. Kurapati)

* Various HTML / print stylesheet tweaks, including showing hyperlinks and
  layout enhancements. (Suraj N. Kurapati)

* HTML layout width now emulates an 80 character precisely (Suraj N. Kurapati)

* URLs for hyperlinks are now included in roff output immediately after the
  hyperlink text. (Suraj N. Kurapati)

0.5 (2010 April 24)
-------------------

* Fixed a bug in roff output where multiple successive newlines were being
  collapsed into a single newline in preformatted output.

* Hexidecimal and decimal entity references generated by the Markdown to HTML
  conversion are now properly decoded into normal characters in roff output.

* The compatibility shims that allowed the ronn command to be invoked as "ron",
  and the ronn library to be required as "ron", have been removed.


0.4 (2010 March 08)
-------------------

* Ron has been renamed "Ronn", including the "ronn" command and the "ronn"
  library. Compatibility shims are included in this release but will be removed
  in the next release.

* The hpricot library is now used for HTML hackery instead of the nokogiri
  library. The hpricot library is preferred because it doesn't depend on external
  system dependencies.
