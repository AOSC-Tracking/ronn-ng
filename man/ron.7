.TH "RON" 7 "December 2009" "Ryan Tomayko" "Ron Manual"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBron\fR \-\- the opposite of roff
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Ron is a humane text format and toolchain for creating UNIX man
pages, and things that appear as man pages from a distance. Use it
to build and install standard UNIX roff man pages or to generate
nicely formatted HTML manual pages for the web.
.
.P
The Ron file format is based on Markdown. In fact, Ron files are a
compatible subset of Markdown syntax but have a more rigid structure and
extend Markdown in some ways to provide features commonly found in man
pages (e.g., definition lists). The ron(5) manual page defines the
format in more detail.
.
.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
The \fB.ron\fR files located under the \fBman/\fR directory show off a wide
range of ron capabilities and are the source of Ron's own documentation.
The source files and generated HTML / roff output files are available
at:
.
.SH "INSTALL"
Install with Rubygems:
.
.nf
$ [sudo] gem install ron
$ ron \-\-help 
.
.fi
.
.P
Or, clone the git repository:
.
.nf
$ git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/ron.git
$ PATH=ron/bin:$PATH
$ ron \-\-help 
.
.fi
.
.SH "BASIC USAGE"
To generate a roff man page from the included \fI\fBmarkdown.5.ron\fR\fR file and open it with man(1):
.
.nf
$ ron \-b man/markdown.5.ron
building: man/markdown.5
$ man man/markdown.5 
.
.fi
.
.P
To generate a standalone HTML version:
.
.nf
$ ron \-b \-\-html man/markdown.5.ron
building: man/markdown.5.html
$ open man/markdown.5.html 
.
.fi
.
.P
To build roff and HTML versions of all ron files:
.
.nf
$ ron \-b \-\-roff \-\-html man/*.ron 
.
.fi
.
.P
If you just want to view a ron file as if it were a man page without
building intermediate files:
.
.nf
$ ron \-m man/markdown.5.ron 
.
.fi
.
.P
The \fIron(1)\fR manual page
includes comprehensive documentation on \fBron\fR command line options.
.
.SH "ABOUT"
Some people think UNIX manual pages are a poor and outdated style of
documentation. I disagree:
.
.P
Unfortunately, trying to figure out how to create a man page is a
fairly tedious process. The roff/man macro languages are highly
extensible, fractured between multiple dialects, and include a bunch
of device specific stuff that's entirely irrelevant to modern
publishing tools.
.
.P
Ron aims to address many of the issues with man page creation while
preserving the things that makes man pages a great form of
documentation.
