angle_bracket_syntax(5) -- angle bracket syntax test
====================================================

A <WORD> in angle brackets is converted to <var>WORD</var>,

    except when <WORD> is
    part of a preformatted
    code block,

or when `<WORD>` is enclosed in backticks.

or when <WORD> has a <dot.> or <foo:colon>.

## Escaping angle brackets

You can escape \<angle\> \<brackets\> with backslashes, since we're using GitHub Flavored Markdown.

Example:

`pxzgrep` [`-p`\<n\>] [`-V`] [\<xzgrep options\>] \<pattern\> \<file1\> \<file2\> [\<more files\>]

(Though really you should just put that in a fenced code block.)
