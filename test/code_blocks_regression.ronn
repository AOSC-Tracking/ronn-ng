Example Quote Error
===================

## In the text:

This is Renzo's code.

Debian's lintian returns the following warning:
acute-accent-in-manual-page 

This manual page uses the \' groff sequence. Usually, the intent to
generate an apostrophe, but that sequence actually renders as a an acute
accent.
    
For an apostrophe or a single closing quote, use plain '. For single
opening quote, i.e. a straight downward line ' like the one used in
shell commands, use &#92;(aq.

## Basic code block

The situation is even worse when there are code blocks, mainly code
chunks or commands. E.g., copy-paste fails.

Type the following command `echo 'Hello World'`.

``` bash
$ echo 'hello world'
```

The following code cannot be compiled:
``` C
int main() {
	int example = 42;
	switch (example) {
		case 'a': return 10;
		default: return 42;
	}
}
```
